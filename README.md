# This is a simple snake game with multiple levels.
## How to play?
1) Snakes are represented by red dots, they move autonomously
2) A diamond is represented by blue dot, which on clicking increments the score by 10 and level by 1
3) With each new level, one more snake is added
4) If cursor is hovered over the snake (red points), score decreases by 10
5) As game progresses it becomes difficult to take the diamond without incurring a penalty
